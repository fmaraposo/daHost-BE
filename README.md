# daHost App

NOTE: There's a bug still to be fixed. You just need to login twice. Soon it will be fixed

DaHost is an interactive MERN stack Application, created to democratize party's music choice! The concept is quite similar to Kahoot, where a Host User sign in with his/her spotify account, and start creating a quiz. When the quiz is submited , a code is generated with which the Host User can share the quiz with the other Guest Users. The Game Is On!

The guest users start answering the quiz questions, and their answers will generate a collaborative spotify playlist in the Host User's account! 

The next step, is having fun!
